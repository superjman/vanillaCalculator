# vanillaCalculator
A simple calculator coded in vanilla frontend. Made for educational purposes.
> A simple calculator that I made in vanilla to see the difference between
vanilla and reactjs. Only had basic functions and not much if any error
checking has been implemented. I might come back and add more functionality.
